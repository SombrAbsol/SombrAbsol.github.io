"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The hardy type. You do your homework diligently, <!--break-->and you know to eat properly. You have strong willpower that lets <!--break-->you complete tasks, however tough. But, you can also be stubborn to the <!--break-->point of even feuding with friends... Nothing will go right for you when you're <!--break-->irritated, so learn to laugh it off. A hardy person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The docile type. You're very kindhearted.  <!--break-->Very helpful.  <!--break-->You can make friends with anyone. You're a wonderful person. ...... Is that going overboard?  <!--break-->I don't think so. You yourself should be <!--break-->the best judge of that. A docile person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The brave type. You have a strong sense of justice.  <!--break-->You hate evil.  <!--break-->You will take on any opponent. You are truly a hero! Go forth! For justice...  <!--break-->For peace on earth...  <!--break-->Fight the forces of evil! ...... If I'm wrong...  <!--break-->Work at becoming a true hero! A brave person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The jolly type. Always laughing and smiling, <!--break-->you uplift everyone around you. You love jokes! You have lots of friends, and <!--break-->you're popular wherever you go. But sometimes you get carried away <!--break-->and say things that get you in trouble. You should learn to think before <!--break-->saying or doing anything. A jolly person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The impish type. You're playful, cheerful, <!--break-->and you love pranks. You're also kindhearted. That's why the people around <!--break-->you find you so irresistible. You must be the most <!--break-->popular person around! Oh?  You're not that popular?  <!--break-->You're either being modest... <!--break-->or you just don't notice it. I bet people are just too shy <!--break-->to let their feelings be known. There's someone out there who's <!--break-->afraid to declare their love for you! An impish person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The naive type. You are highly curious, <!--break-->and you love rare things. Your cheerful and carefree <!--break-->attitude should make things fun <!--break-->for the people around you. But you do have one flaw. <!--break-->You can be childish. You can never sit still. <!--break-->You're always on the move. You can also be selfish, <!--break-->so you should watch yourself. A naive person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The timid type. You may find it hard to go <!--break-->to the washroom at night. You may also find it too frightening <!--break-->to go back to school to get something <!--break-->you left behind in class. If you're ever walking on a dark <!--break-->street at night, you probably turn <!--break-->around often to check behind you. But your timid nature is <!--break-->also your good point! Because those who know fear are <!--break-->those who know true courage. A timid person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The hasty type. You like to take charge <!--break-->and get things done. You're a real go-getter. But are you also stressed out? You get irritated when your <!--break-->friends don't show up on time. You get frustrated when things <!--break-->don't turn out the way you expect. Maybe you jab the elevator button <!--break-->if the elevator is slow to arrive. ...Maybe you're already jabbing <!--break-->the A Button repeatedly now. Beware--getting too easily irritated <!--break-->just isn't good for your well-being. A hasty person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The sassy type. You tend to be somewhat cynical. Despite that, there is something <!--break-->appealing and lovable about you. But do you occasionally say something <!--break-->arrogant that angers others? Do you make that mistake? Or have people called you <!--break-->conceited, vain, or selfish? Have people said that about you? Huh?  You're telling me to get lost? Why, you... Come here and say that!  <!--break-->......Gasp! ...I'm sorry. <!--break-->I let my feelings run away. <!--break-->I truly regret this, really. Anyway, your cool and aloof <!--break-->attitude is what defines you. It makes you exasperating and <!--break-->appealing at the same time. A sassy person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The calm type. You're capable of giving advice <!--break-->to friends with worries. You don't like to fight. You're a warm, kindhearted <!--break-->person who cares. You must have many friends <!--break-->who look up to you. However...  <!--break-->You may also be somewhat gullible... As well as a little careless... And even a little sloppy. You might want to keep <!--break-->those points in mind. A calm person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The relaxed type. Do you occasionally <!--break-->zone out and miss a bus? Or do you find yourself dozing off? Or is your reaction time <!--break-->a little slower than others? But that's not necessarily <!--break-->a bad thing. You can do things at your own <!--break-->tempo without feeling pressured. You can live in a relaxed and <!--break-->unhurried manner without worries. I think that's a happy <!--break-->lifestyle to be envied, even. You're also surprisingly popular. The way you vacantly stare <!--break-->off into the distance... It should make that someone <!--break-->special's pulse race. A relaxed person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The lonely type. You always act cheerful and <!--break-->jocular around other people. But that's only because <!--break-->you are with other people. However, when you get alone... Do you find yourself <!--break-->feeling oddly depressed? That's why you always <!--break-->want to be with others. But if you go around feeling <!--break-->depressed too much... Your nutritional balance goes out <!--break-->of wack. Eat more vegetables! However...  <!--break-->It's not a bad thing <!--break-->to feel lonely. You know what it's like when you aren't <!--break-->alone, so that's why you feel lonesome. And that's why you aren't really alone. A lonely person like you should be...",
"You appear to be...  <!--break-->The quirky type. People consider you an eccentric <!--break-->who does things at your own pace. You never break tempo. Your carefree nature makes you <!--break-->attractive. But you also happen <!--break-->to be somewhat childish... You are fickle and cause problems for the <!--break-->people who have to go along with you. Maybe people are even upset <!--break-->with you for being so fickle? If you realize how selfishly <!--break-->you're behaving, try to think <!--break-->before you do anything rash. A quirky person like you should be...",
